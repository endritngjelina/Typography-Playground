# Typography Playground

A front-end project showcasing a series of interactive HTML typography experiments. Each file explores different aspects of typographic design — including font pairing, weight contrast, line spacing, letter spacing, and layout hierarchy — making this a practical reference for web design and UI development.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🚀 Getting Started

No build tools or dependencies required. Simply clone the repo and open any HTML file in your browser.

### Tips
- **Update the file descriptions** in the table once you know what each `typography playground N.html` actually covers — the descriptions above are placeholder-friendly guesses based on common typography experiment progressions.
- Add a **live demo link** (e.g., via GitHub Pages) to the README once you deploy it — it would make this repo much more discoverable .
